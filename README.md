**Note**:
* Since React 0.14 some node modules such as react-* are no longer ready to be complient with react 0.14.
Don't use it or install it manually.

* Don't forget to install react-dom since 0.14 split it from react.

* Package redux and react-redux are different but you need both.

* Until next release this warning will appear. This is due to new react 0.14.

```javascript

 Warning: React.findDOMNode is deprecated. Please use ReactDOM.findDOMNode from require('react-dom') instead.

```
